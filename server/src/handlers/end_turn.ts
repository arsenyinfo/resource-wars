    // 2. Calculate resource production based on building types and levels
    // 3. Update player's resource counts accordingly

    // - SAWMILL: produces wood based on level (e.g., level * 10 wood per turn)
    // - QUARRY: produces stone based on level (e.g., level * 8 stone per turn)
    // - FARM: produces food based on level (e.g., level * 12 food per turn)
    // - MARKET: produces gold based on level (e.g., level * 5 gold per turn)
